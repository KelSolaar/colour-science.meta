# Project: Task 5 - Detailed Configuration Files Analysis

## Background and Motivation

Task 5 performs an in-depth analysis of key configuration files across the colour-science ecosystem. The analysis focuses on five critical configuration file types (GitHub workflows, pre-commit configs, tasks.py, docs/conf.py, and pyproject.toml) using the `colour` repository as reference. This analysis goes beyond simple line differences to understand semantic variations and generate actionable recommendations for standardization.

## Affected Repositories
- [x] colour/ (core reference repository)
- [x] colour-checker-detection/
- [x] colour-clf-io/
- [x] colour-dash/
- [x] colour-datasets/
- [x] colour-demosaicing/
- [x] colour-hdri/
- [x] colour-specio/
- [x] colour-visuals/
- [x] colour-science.meta/ (execution location)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Multi-format Parsing**: Handle YAML, TOML, and Python configuration files
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Understand functional differences beyond line counts
3. **Missing File Handling**: Gracefully handle repositories lacking configs
4. **Table Formatting**: Generate properly aligned Markdown tables
5. **Actionable Insights**: Produce specific recommendations for standardization
6. **Performance**: Efficiently analyze all files across 9 repositories

## High-level Task Breakdown

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**PLANNING TASK 5: Enhanced Configuration Analysis**

**Current Resources Available**:
✅ **Configuration Data**: Task 3 JSON with 122 files across 10 repositories
✅ **Enhanced Scripts**: Configuration analyzer with semantic analysis capabilities
✅ **Report Generator**: Advanced formatting with grouping patterns
✅ **Task Specification**: Fully updated algorithm matching implementation
✅ **Previous Analysis**: Successful configuration-files-analysis.md (332 lines)

**Enhanced Features Ready**:
- Grouping by configuration type rather than repository
- Hook configuration differences grouped by hook type
- Dependency analysis grouped by usage patterns
- Tool configuration differences grouped by setting type
- Relative path usage throughout
- Empty subsection removal
- Repository names with backticks for readability

**Ready to Execute**:
- All scripts tested and working
- Algorithm synchronized with implementation
- Input data validated and available
- Output format specified and tested

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

None at this time. Ready to implement configuration analysis.

## Lessons

- Semantic analysis provides more value than line-by-line comparison
- Table formatting with proper alignment improves readability
- Full repository names in headers clarify analysis scope
- Centered checkmarks create visual consistency

## Implementation Details

### Task 5 Analysis Plan

**Objective**: Perform detailed semantic analysis of 5 configuration file types.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `ConfigurationAnalyzer` class
2. Implement parsers for YAML, TOML, and Python files
3. Analyze differences at semantic level (not just line counts)
4. Generate Markdown report with aligned tables

**Script Structure**: `.sandbox/detailed_config_analyzer.py`
- Load JSON data from Task 3
- Parse configuration files using appropriate libraries
- Compare against colour repository baseline
- Format findings into readable Markdown tables

**Expected Output**: `.sandbox/detailed-config-analysis.md`
- Executive summary with key metrics
- 5 sections for each configuration type
- Properly aligned tables with centered checkmarks
- Prioritized recommendations

### Validation Criteria

**Script Functionality**:
- Successfully loads JSON configuration data
- Handles missing files gracefully without crashing
- Parses YAML/TOML files correctly
- Generates valid Markdown output

**Report Quality**:
- All tables properly aligned with consistent formatting
- Checkmarks centered in appropriate columns
- Full repository names used in headers
- Clear section organization

**Analysis Accuracy**:
- Correctly identifies missing configurations
- Detects version differences in tools
- Finds workflow variations
- Produces actionable recommendations

### Execution Commands

```bash
# Task 5: Detailed configuration analysis
python3 .sandbox/detailed_config_analyzer.py

# Validation commands
head -20 .sandbox/detailed-config-analysis.md  # Check report header
grep -c "^|" .sandbox/detailed-config-analysis.md  # Count table rows
grep "Priority" .sandbox/detailed-config-analysis.md  # Check recommendations
```
